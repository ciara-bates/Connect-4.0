# Connect-4.0
 ### Arduino project for an interactive Connect4 board 
 ### Module: Gizmo (physical computing) | December 2021
 Connect 4.0 combines the tactile interaction of traditional board games with the smart and responsive experience that we're all used to with mobile gaming. The LCD   display prompts each player to make their moves whilst the infrared sensors on the top of each column will keep track of where each player has gone. An Arduino mega board on the back of the game is used to process these inputs and lets you know when the game has been won. The code involves handing sensor data and then translating that into a 2D array representaing the current state of the board. Checks are done every loop to see if there are any rows/columns/diagonals of 4. This was the first big Arduino project that I have created independantly - and I am glad to say that it resulted in a functional prototype!
